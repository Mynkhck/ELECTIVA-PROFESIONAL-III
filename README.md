If you want to explore quickly, search for “Getting started” sections in the docs. They provide concrete steps you can follow to begin using the materials right away.

Getting started with the materials
The materials are designed to be friendly for learners and educators alike. Here is a practical approach to begin using them:
- Identify your goal. Are you preparing a lesson, building a hands-on project, or validating a concept?
- Locate the corresponding module or exercise. The materials are organized by topic for easy navigation.
- Read the introductory notes. They explain the motivation and the expected outcomes.
- Run the example. Use the provided code or templates to observe how the concept works in practice.
- Modify and experiment. Small changes help you see how the system behaves and deepen understanding.
- Document your results. Use the included templates to capture what you learned.

If you are an instructor, you can adapt the materials for your class. The modular design makes it easy to assemble a custom syllabus. If you are a student, you can use the resources to supplement lectures and practice on your own.

How to use the releases
The releases provide ready-to-use assets that you can run directly. They are especially helpful for students who want to see a complete working environment without building from scratch. When you use a release asset, you can expect the following:
- A pre-configured workspace with examples and templates.
- A guided starter within the asset, including a quick-start guide.
- Sample data sets that illustrate real-world scenarios.
- A set of checks or validations you can run to verify behavior.
- A clear path to extend the material with your own content.

Remember, the release asset is an entry point. You can evolve the environment by adding your own files, updating templates, and linking to additional references as needed.
